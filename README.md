The **YOLOv8 Hard Hat Detection System** is a real-time object detection solution designed for A production-ready hard-hat and safety vest detection system built with YOLOv8 and FastAPI for construction-site safety monitoring.
​- It trains and evaluates a helmet/person/safety-vest detector in a Kaggle notebook, then packages the best model with a REST API and deployment scripts.
​- Clients or web frontends can upload images to the API and receive JSON detections plus annotated images and analysis  for visual PPE compliance checks in real time.
